Our aim is to instrument a crutch system that will allow both patient and medical professional to get specific feedback on how well the partial weight bearing program is being implemented by the patient. This will help the professional tailor the rehabilitation program based on how well the patient has adhered to it and how effective it has been in terms of recovery, ultimately speeding up the process.   Currently, there are no existing products on the market that will give feedback on how a patient is walking, although there have been previous experiments which have attempted to instrument crutches, or provide a system by which a person can gain feedback on their walking style. They have proven to be either too bulky to be used in a patient's day to day life [1] or did not attempt to make the crutch system user friendly for the patient or medical professional. There is however the possibility of either instrumenting two crutches or just the one, to obtain the same information
